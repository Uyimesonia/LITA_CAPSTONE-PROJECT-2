### Project 2 Tittle:Customers Subscription Analysis

### Project Overview
___

This analysis explores revenue generation across different subscription types
(Basic, Premium, and Standard) and across various regions (East, North, South, West) for 2022 and 2023. Explain that the purpose of
this analysis is to uncover which subscription types and regions have the highest contribution to revenue and how they compare over the two years.

#### The Main Findings:
- Basic subscriptions contributed the highest total revenue, with East and North regions showing nearly identical revenue amount
- Standard subscriptions brought in revenue exclusively from the West, which might indicate a preference or specific targeting in that regionnue amounts
- Premium subscriptions performed strongly in the South region, matching the Basic tierâ€™s revenue in East and North.
  
#### Analysis Over Time:
- In the east region, the basic subscription revenue dropped from 2022 to 2023.
- The west region's standard subscription revenue slightly declined as well. 

#### Insights And Implication
- The consistent revenue generation of Basic subscriptions in both East and North could suggest a stable market with strong demand.
- Premium subscriptions concentrated in the South might reflect a demographic or economic preference in that region for higher-tier services.
- Standard subscriptions limited to the West could indicate a regionalized strategy, where this subscription type appeals to that specific audience.

#### Recommendations
 - Expand Premium offerings in other regions like North and East, if market research supports demand.
 - Investigate the decline in Basic and Standard subscriptions for potential improvement areas or marketing efforts to regain traction.
 - Enhance loyalty programs for regions like the South to retain the high Premium subscriber base.
