### Project 2 Tittle:Customers Subscription Analysis

### Project Overview
___

This analysis explores revenue generation across different subscription types
(Basic, Premium, and Standard) and across various regions (East, North, South, West) for 2022 and 2023. Explain that the purpose of
this analysis is to uncover which subscription types and regions have the highest contribution to revenue and how they compare over the two years.

#### The Main Findings:
- Basic subscriptions contributed the highest total revenue, with East and North regions showing nearly identical revenue amount
- Standard subscriptions brought in revenue exclusively from the West, which might indicate a preference or specific targeting in that regionnue amounts
- Premium subscriptions performed strongly in the South region, matching the Basic tierâ€™s revenue in East and North.
  
#### Analysis Over Time:
- In the east region, the basic subscription revenue dropped from 2022 to 2023.
- The west region's standard subscription revenue slightly declined as well. 

#### Insights And Implication
- The consistent revenue generation of Basic subscriptions in both East and North could suggest a stable market with strong demand.
- Premium subscriptions concentrated in the South might reflect a demographic or economic preference in that region for higher-tier services.
- Standard subscriptions limited to the West could indicate a regionalized strategy, where this subscription type appeals to that specific audience.

#### Recommendations
 - Expand Premium offerings in other regions like North and East, if market research supports demand.
 - Investigate the decline in Basic and Standard subscriptions for potential improvement areas or marketing efforts to regain traction.
 - Enhance loyalty programs for regions like the South to retain the high Premium subscriber base.

 
#### Tools Used
___

#### Microsoft Excel
  The excel and pivot table functions helped carry out several important tasks for analyzing and presenting this data such as;
  - Data summarization-The pivot table summarized large amount of data by catergorizing it into different groups:
  subscription types ( basic, premium and standard) , Region ( east, north, south and west) And Year (2022,2023)
  - Data Aggregation-By using the sum of revenue as the main matrics, the pivot table quickly totaled up revenue amount accross different catergories.
  This type of aggregation makes it easy to see the total revenue by subscription type, region, and overall.
  - comparism accross catergories-The pivot table enable easy comparism accross catergories. By separating the data into years, the table also allow a year over year comparism to identify
  any trends or changes.
  - Filtering and Organization-The data is organized hierachically in the pivot table format, showing the main catergories at the top levels and allowing expansion for more detailed insights
    ( eg,region-specific or year-specific data under each subscription type).

    Overall, excel and the pivot table provided a stream lined effecient way to summarize, catergorize and interpret this data, turning raw informations into actionable insight.
    this analysis could then be used for strategic decisions, such as marketing efforts and subscription improvements.

    #### Structured Querry Language (sql)
    using Sql on this data can offer similar insights to those found in excel,but sql also allow for more advance querrying ,filtering and joining accross
    tables if additional datasets are available such as:
  - retrieve the total sales for each product category.
  - find the number of sales transactions in each region.
  -find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
  - calculate total revenue per product."
  -calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.

  - calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
  - identify products with no sales in the last quarter.
